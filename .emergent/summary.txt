The previous AI engineer developed a portfolio website from scratch, then transitioned to bug fixes, feature enhancements, and significant architectural changes. The work began with a critical bug in the admin's save button, which led to a deeper refactor of state management and component structure. Key architectural decisions included migrating from traditional admin forms to a modern inline editing system directly on public pages, requiring extensive frontend and backend modifications. Subsequent tasks focused on enhancing content presentation, particularly image handling, evolving from basic image uploads to advanced adaptive container sizing based on image dimensions, prioritizing quality. Performance optimizations and comprehensive error resolution were continuous efforts throughout the trajectory. The current state involves refining visual presentation and cleaning up the interface by hiding empty elements.

<product_requirements>
The product is a portfolio website built with React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB (database).
**Initial Problem:** The save button in the admin console was not functioning correctly, causing data to be lost or reset.
**Feature Evolution:**
1.  **Save Button Fix:** Ensure data persistence in admin forms.
2.  **Mission Management:** Initially, a Mission 3 tab was requested, then clarified to be a *fourth mission* within the existing Stage 1ère année section. This fourth mission's content structure evolved, ultimately becoming similar in style to Mission 1 and 2, resulting in a total of three distinct missions per stage.
3.  **Admin Interface Refinement:**
    *   Resolve admin console errors (e.g., JavaScript errors, field persistence issues).
    *   Transition from a separate admin dashboard with forms to an inline editing system where content is directly modifiable on public pages.
4.  **Image Integration:**
    *   Add sections for company logos, workplace photos, and tools.
    *   Allow users to upload multiple images per mission.
    *   Introduce a dedicated section for building plans and offices with multiple image slots.
    *   Implement image upload directly within the editor.
    *   Initially, images were to be auto-resized; this was refined to make the *image containers adapt* to the uploaded image's dimensions while preserving aspect ratio and quality.
5.  **Overall Optimization:** Analyze, debug, and optimize the entire application for performance, stability, and a clean user experience, including hiding empty content sections.

**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Summary of importance**: This is the primary frontend file, encompassing all React components, routing logic, and core UI functionalities. It acts as the central hub for the entire client-side application.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        *   **Save Button & State Persistence**: Implemented  in  to ensure form data persists after saving, preventing unintentional resets.
        *   **Mission Structure Adjustments**: Modified the data structure and rendering logic to support a dynamic number of missions (initially 4, then reverted to 3), each with specialized fields (e.g., , ).
        *   **Inline Editing Integration**: Replaced the traditional  and its sub-forms (, , ) with  and  components. These components allow direct content modification on the public-facing pages in admin mode, handling state management and API interactions.
        *   **Image Content Sections**: Added new sections for , , a list of  (each with a name and image),  (four image slots), and  within each mission.
        *   **Dynamic Image Sizing**: Reworked image display logic within  to make containers adapt to the uploaded image's aspect ratio and dimensions, rather than enforcing fixed image sizes, while still respecting maximum dimension limits per section.
        *   **Performance Optimizations**: Applied , , and  to key components and functions, and introduced a  custom hook to minimize re-renders and improve frontend performance.

-   :
    -   **Summary of importance**: This is the core FastAPI application handling all backend API requests, data models, and MongoDB interactions. It's crucial for data persistence and application logic.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        *   **API Endpoint Refinements**: Addressed and corrected various API errors (403, 422, 404) by enhancing the admin authentication system (using secure session cookies) and ensuring all necessary endpoints (e.g., ) were properly implemented and accessible.
        *   **Data Model Updates**: Extended Pydantic data models to accommodate the newly introduced image fields (e.g., , ,  array,  array, and  within mission entries).
        *   **Image Upload Handling**: Implemented a dedicated and secure  endpoint to process and store uploaded images, converting them to base64 format for frontend consumption.
        *   **Backend Optimization**: Improved logging for debugging, reinforced data validation with Pydantic, and implemented robust error handling mechanisms across the API.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer had just completed a significant enhancement to the image display system on the portfolio site. The user's initial request was to redimensionne les images (resize images). The AI engineer first implemented an automatic image resizing feature (to 800x600px max, 80% JPEG compression) and adjusted fixed sizes for various sections (logo, tools, plans, missions) in .

However, the user clarified their intent, stating: change plutot la case de la photo que la photo en elle meme, tu prends les dimensions de la photo et tu adaptes la case aul ieux de faire linverse (change the image box rather than the photo itself, take the dimensions of the photo and adapt the box instead of doing the reverse).

In response, the AI engineer refactored the  component in  to implement an adaptive container system. This new system now dynamically calculates and adjusts the dimensions of the image container (the case) based on the actual uploaded image's aspect ratio (landscape, portrait, square). It applies maximum width/height limits configured per section (e.g., 300x200px for Logo, 80x80px for Tools, 350x250px for Plans, 250x200px for Mission Images, with a special case of 500x200px for the 3rd mission's images). This ensures that images retain their original quality and proportions, without being stretched or distorted, while the UI gracefully adapts. The change also included adding dimension badges in edit mode and a delete button. This work has been completed and tested.
